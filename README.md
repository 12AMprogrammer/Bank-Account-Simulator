# Bank-Account-Simulator
A C# GUI to show how one might code withdrawls and deposits.
The BankAccount.cs file uses getters and setters to make sure the balance stays private to that class.
The maincode.cs file contains most of the coding, design, and logic. It calls methods from the
BankAccount class using an object from that class. The .jpg files shows the gui.
